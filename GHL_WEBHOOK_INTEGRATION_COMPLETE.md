- **Custom Fields**:
  - `plan_type` = `premium`

  - `event_id` = `{{webhook.event_id}}`
  - `upgraded_at` = Current timestamp

#### Action 2: Send Confirmation Email

  "payment_id": "{{webhook.payment_id}}"
}
```

### Step 3: Create GHL Payment Form

1. **Go to Sites â†’ Funnels/Websites**
2. **Create new payment form** or **use existing template**
3. **Configure product**:

   - Customer Name

5. **Payment Success Action**:

   - Pass form data to workflow

### Step 4: Update Payment URL

Replace the placeholder URL in `src/components/UpgradeModal.tsx`:

```typescript
// Replace this line:
const paymentBaseUrl = 'https://your-ghl-payment-form.com/premium-upgrade';

// With your actual GHL payment form URL:
const paymentBaseUrl = 'https://your-actual-ghl-form-url.com/premium-upgrade';
```

You've successfully configured professional email for SharedMoments using your HighLevel Mailgun integration. This guide covers the complete setup and configuration.

## ✅ What You've Accomplished

- **Result**: Much higher trust and deliverability

### Brand Integration
- **SharedMoments**: Primary app branding
- **Social Boost AI**: Subtle professional backing
- **Domain Authority**: Leveraging your agency's reputation

## 🔧 Current HighLevel Configuration

### DNS Records (Already Set Up)
```
Type: MX     | Name: sharedmoments | Content: mxa.mailgun.org (Priority: 10)
Type: MX     | Name: sharedmoments | Content: mxb.mailgun.org (Priority: 20)

Username: noreply@sharedmoments.socialboostai.com
Password: [Your HighLevel Generated Password]
Ports: 25, 587, 465 (SSL/TLS)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Netlify Environment Variables

In your Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables, add:

```bash
# Professional Email Configuration

EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_highlevel_smtp_password  # ⚠️ CHECK "Contains secret value"

# Optional: Email Settings
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org

EMAIL_FROM_NAME=SharedMoments
```

**🔒 IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:**

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**

### **Root Cause**
- Missing Cloudflare Worker environment secrets that got cleared during recent deployments
- Your local .env variables were fine, but the Worker needed separate configuration

### **Solution Applied**
```bash
✅ NETLIFY_EMAIL_FUNCTION_URL = "https://main--sharedmoments.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/email-download"
✅ R2_PUBLIC_URL = "https://sharedmomentsphotos.socialboostai.com"
✅ Worker redeployed with updated configuration
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Durable Objects Architecture**
Your system now uses the exact architecture you suggested:

**✅ IMPLEMENTED EXACTLY AS REQUESTED**

### **Firebase Integration**
- Triggers Worker when files are ready
- Worker processes via Durable Objects
- Notifies Netlify backend upon completion
- Professional email delivery system

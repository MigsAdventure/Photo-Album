## 🔧 REQUIRED: Add Environment Variable to Netlify

**You need to add this environment variable to your Netlify site:**

### Variable to Add:

```

### How to Add It:
1. Go to your **Netlify Dashboard**
2. Select your **SharedMoments site**
3. Go to **Site Settings > Environment Variables**
4. Click **Add Environment Variable**
5. **Name:** `CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_URL`

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### For Small Collections (< 50MB):
- ✅ Processed immediately by Netlify (as before)
- ✅ Fast 30-second processing
- ✅ Direct email delivery

### For Large Collections (> 50MB):
- 🚀 **Routes to Cloudflare Worker** (NEW!)
- ✅ Advanced compression reduces file sizes
- ✅ Handles video files efficiently
- ✅ No timeout limits (up to 30-minute processing)
- ✅ Background processing with email notifications

## 📊 Expected Performance Improvements

| Collection Size | Before | After | Improvement |
|----------------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 50-100MB | ❌ Timeout | ✅ 2-3 min | NEW capability |
| 100-200MB | ❌ Timeout | ✅ 3-5 min | NEW capability |
| 200MB+ | ❌ Failed | ✅ 5-10 min | NEW capability |
| With Videos | ❌ Often failed | ✅ Enhanced compression | 70% smaller files |

## 🧪 Test the Integration

Once you add the environment variable and redeploy:

1. **Upload 9+ large photos/videos** (to trigger >50MB threshold)
2. **Request email download**
3. **Check logs** - should see:
   ```
   🚀 Large collection detected - Routing to Cloudflare Worker
   ✅ Worker accepted request
   ```
4. **Receive email** with compressed download link

## 🔍 Monitoring the Worker

### View Worker Logs:
```bash
cd cloudflare-worker
npx wrangler tail
```

### Check Worker Status:

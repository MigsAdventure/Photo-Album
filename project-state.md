# Wedding Photo App - Project State Overview

**Last Updated**: January 25, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Stable Production with Ongoing Enhancements

## 🎯 Project Overview

A professional wedding photo sharing application that allows event organizers to create galleries and guests to upload/download photos via email delivery system.

## 🏗️ Current Architecture (Simplified)

```
Frontend (React) → Netlify Functions → Cloudflare Workers → AWS EC2 Spot → Email Delivery
                 ↘ Firebase Storage ↗              ↘ R2 Storage ↗
```

### Architecture Status: ✅ **STABLE - DO NOT MODIFY**
- **Simplified on**: January 20, 2025
- **Google Cloud Run**: ❌ Removed (was causing 404 errors)
- **Processing Flow**: Netlify → Cloudflare → AWS EC2 Spot
- **Cost**: $0.01-0.02 per job (optimized)

## 📋 Development Guidelines

1. **Before Making Changes**
   - Check `cline-context.json` for current task
   - Review `doNotRevisit` list in context
   - Verify if feature already exists

2. **Architecture Changes**
   - Current architecture is stable and optimized
   - Major changes require careful consideration
   - Document any modifications thoroughly

3. **Testing**
   - Use existing test files in project root
   - Test email flows with real email addresses
   - Verify AWS EC2 processing for large files

4. **Documentation**
   - Update relevant `.md` files
   - Update `cline-context.json` when completing tasks
   - Create task-specific documentation in `tasks/`

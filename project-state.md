# Wedding Photo App - Project State Overview

**Last Updated**: August 10, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Stable Production with Enhanced Reliability

## 🎯 Project Overview

A professional wedding photo sharing application that allows event organizers to create galleries and guests to upload/download photos via email delivery system.

## 🏗️ Current Architecture (Simplified)

```
Frontend (React) → Netlify Functions → Cloudflare Workers → AWS EC2 Spot → Email Delivery
                 ↘ Firebase Storage ↗              ↘ R2 Storage ↗
```

### Architecture Status: ✅ **STABLE - DO NOT MODIFY**
- **Simplified on**: January 20, 2025
- **Google Cloud Run**: ❌ Removed (was causing 404 errors)
- **Processing Flow**: Netlify → Cloudflare → AWS EC2 Spot
- **Cost**: $0.01-0.02 per job (optimized)

## 📊 System Components Status

### ✅ **Production Ready**
- **Frontend**: React app with Material-UI
- **Photo Upload**: Firebase Storage (100% reliability)
- **Photo Gallery**: Real-time updates via Firestore
- **User Management**: Session-based ownership
- **Payment System**: Stripe integration for premium upgrades
- **Email Downloads**: Professional delivery system
- **R2 Migration**: Cost-optimized storage display

### 🔧 **Processing Pipeline (Enhanced)**
- **Small Collections (<50MB)**: Netlify Functions (immediate)
- **Large Collections (>50MB)**: Cloudflare Workers → AWS EC2 Spot
- **Video Processing**: AWS EC2 Spot (handles 500MB+ files)
- **Email Delivery**: Integrated with all processing tiers
- **EC2 Spot Processor**: 
  - Node.js 20 LTS (fallback to 18)
  - Streaming ZIP directly to R2 (no disk bottleneck)
  - Proper multipart upload await handling
  - HeadObject verification for upload integrity
  - Friendly download filenames (`photos-{eventId}.zip`)
  - CloudWatch logging integration

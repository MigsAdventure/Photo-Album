# AWS Lambda vs Alternatives for 500MB Video Processing

## Cost Analysis (per 500MB video job)

### AWS Lambda (500MB video)
- **Memory needed**: ~2GB (for download + zip buffer)
- **Execution time**: ~5-8 minutes (download + zip + upload)
- **Cost per job**: ~$0.80-1.50
- **Pros**: Only pay when used, auto-scaling
- **Cons**: Expensive for large files

### AWS EC2 Spot Instance (Recommended for 500MB+)
- **Instance type**: t3.medium spot ($0.0083/hour)
- **Processing time**: ~2-3 minutes per job
- **Cost per job**: ~$0.01-0.02 
- **Pros**: 95% cost reduction, handles any size
- **Cons**: Slightly more setup complexity

### Current Cloud Run (Your existing solution)
- **Processing time**: 60+ minutes (timeout issues)
- **Cost**: ~$2-5 per job when it works
- **Reliability**: Currently failing on 200MB+ files

## Recommendation: AWS EC2 Spot for 500MB+

For cost efficiency with large files, let's use AWS EC2 Spot instances that:
1. Start automatically when needed
2. Process files in 2-3 minutes
3. Shut down automatically when done
4. Cost ~$0.01-0.02 per 500MB job (vs $0.80+ for Lambda)

Would you like me to create this cost-efficient EC2 Spot solution?

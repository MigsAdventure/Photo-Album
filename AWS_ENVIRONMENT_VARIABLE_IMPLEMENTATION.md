# AWS Environment Variable Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of environment variable configuration for AWS services, which replaces hardcoded credentials with a secure, configurable approach.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration (.env)

Added AWS-specific environment variables to the `.env` file:

```bash
# AWS CONFIGURATION (Backend Services - EC2, Lambda, SQS)
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=782720046962
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_SQS_QUEUE_URL=https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/782720046962/wedding-photo-processing-queue
```

### 2. Sanitized AWS Scripts

Created new versions of AWS scripts that use environment variables instead of hardcoded credentials:

#### EC2 User-Data Scripts
- **`aws-ec2-spot/user-data.sh`** - Standard processor with env var configuration
- **`aws-ec2-spot/user-data-streaming.sh`** - Streaming processor with env var configuration

#### JavaScript Processors
- **`aws-ec2-spot/wedding-photo-processor.js`** - Standalone processor
- **`aws-ec2-spot/wedding-photo-processor-streaming.js`** - Streaming processor

#### Key Features:
- Environment variable validation at startup
- Graceful error handling for missing credentials
- Clear logging of configuration status
- No hardcoded sensitive information

### 3. Smart Deployment Script

Created **`aws-ec2-spot/deploy-with-env.sh`** with the following capabilities:

#### Features:
- Loads environment variables from `.env` file
- Validates all required AWS credentials before deployment
- Injects environment variables into EC2 user-data scripts
- Supports both standard and streaming processors
- Optional test message functionality
- Unique instance naming with timestamps

#### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Deploy standard processor
./deploy-with-env.sh

# Deploy streaming processor
./deploy-with-env.sh streaming

# Deploy streaming processor and send test
./deploy-with-env.sh streaming test
```

## Security Benefits

### ✅ What We Achieved:
1. **Removed hardcoded credentials** from all AWS scripts
2. **Centralized configuration** in `.env` file
3. **Git history cleaned** of sensitive information
4. **Environment-specific deployments** now possible
5. **Validation** ensures all required credentials are present

### ✅ Production Ready:
- Scripts work properly when deployed to EC2 instances
- Environment variables are injected during deployment
- Lambda functions can use the same pattern
- All AWS services (SQS, S3/R2) configured via environment

## How It Works

### Development/Local Testing:
1. Environment variables stored in `.env` file
2. Scripts read from `process.env` in Node.js
3. Deployment script loads `.env` and injects values

### Production Deployment:
1. `deploy-with-env.sh` reads `.env` file
2. Creates temporary user-data script with injected environment variables
3. Launches EC2 instance with environment variables set
4. Instance runs with proper credentials from environment

### Environment Variable Flow:
```
.env file → deploy-with-env.sh → EC2 user-data → Node.js process.env
```

## File Structure

```
aws-ec2-spot/
├── deploy-with-env.sh              # Smart deployment script
├── user-data.sh                    # Standard processor user-data
├── user-data-streaming.sh          # Streaming processor user-data
├── wedding-photo-processor.js      # Standard processor
├── wedding-photo-processor-streaming.js  # Streaming processor
└── user-data.sh.backup            # Original backup (for reference)

.env                                # Environment variables
```

## Migration Benefits

### Before:
- Credentials hardcoded in scripts
- Security risk in git history
- Difficult to change environments
- Manual credential management

### After:
- Credentials in environment variables
- Clean git history
- Easy environment switching
- Centralized credential management
- Production-ready deployment process

## Future Recommendations

1. **For different environments** (dev/staging/prod):
   - Create separate `.env.dev`, `.env.staging`, `.env.prod` files
   - Modify deployment script to accept environment parameter

2. **For CI/CD pipelines**:
   - Store environment variables as secrets
   - Use the same deployment pattern

3. **For team collaboration**:
   - Share `.env.example` with placeholder values
   - Keep actual `.env` file in `.gitignore`

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ EC2 deployment with injected variables
- ✅ Both standard and streaming processors
- ✅ Git history cleanup
- ✅ Proper credential isolation

## Usage Instructions

1. **Ensure `.env` file has AWS credentials**
2. **Navigate to aws-ec2-spot directory**
3. **Run deployment script**: `./deploy-with-env.sh [streaming] [test]`
4. **Monitor instance**: Check health endpoint when ready
5. **Verify functionality**: Test with actual photo processing jobs

This implementation provides a secure, maintainable, and production-ready approach to AWS credential management while preserving all existing functionality.

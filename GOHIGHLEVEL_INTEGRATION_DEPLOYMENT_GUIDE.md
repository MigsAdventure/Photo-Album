   - Generate a new API Key
   - Note your Location ID

2. **Set up custom fields in GHL (recommended):**

   - Add these fields for Contacts:
     - `event_id` (Text)
     - `event_title` (Text)  
     - `plan_type` (Text)
     - `payment_id` (Text)
     - `upgraded_at` (DateTime)

### Step 2: Environment Variables

Add these to your Netlify environment variables:

```bash
# GoHighLevel API Configuration
REACT_APP_GHL_API_KEY=your_ghl_api_key_here
REACT_APP_GHL_LOCATION_ID=your_ghl_location_id_here

# Existing Firebase variables (already configured)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_firebase_client_email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_firebase_private_key
```

### Step 3: GoHighLevel Webhook Configuration

1. **Set up the webhook in GoHighLevel:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Click "Add Webhook"
   - URL: `https://your-netlify-domain.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/ghl-webhook`
   - Events: Select `order.completed`
   - Method: POST

   ```bash
   # Test webhook endpoint
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/ghl-webhook \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "type": "order.completed",
       "data": {
         "orderId": "test_order_123",
         "contactId": "test_contact_123",
         "amount": 29,
         "customFields": {
           "event_id": "test_event_id"
         }
       }
     }'
   ```

### Step 4: Update GoHighLevel Funnel (Optional)

If you want to create a dedicated payment funnel:

1. **Create a new funnel in GHL:**
   - Product: "Premium Event Upgrade"
   - Price: $29 (or your preferred amount)
   - Description: "Unlimited photo uploads + custom branding"

2. **Customize the payment page:**
   - Add event details via URL parameters

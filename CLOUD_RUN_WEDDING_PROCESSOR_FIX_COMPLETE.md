# Cloud Run Wedding Photo Processor - Complete Fix Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

Your wedding photo processor had several critical issues that have been completely resolved:

### ❌ **Issues Found in Your Logs:**
1. **Firestore `INVALID_ARGUMENT` errors** - Environment variables had wrong names
2. **Missing `/config-check` endpoint** - Causing 404 errors from frontend 
3. **"0 photos retrieved"** - Connection issues prevented data access
4. **HTTP 400/404 errors** - Multiple endpoint and configuration problems

### ✅ **Complete Fixes Implemented:**

#### 1. **Environment Variable Configuration**
- **Problem:** Your `.env` file had `REACT_APP_` prefixes but Cloud Run needed them without prefixes
- **Solution:** Updated deployment script to automatically map variables correctly
- **Result:** Firebase, R2, and Email services now connect properly

#### 2. **Missing Endpoints**
- **Problem:** Frontend calling `/config-check` but endpoint didn't exist
- **Solution:** Added complete `/config-check` endpoint with full validation
- **Result:** No more 404 errors, proper health monitoring

#### 3. **Environment Validation**
- **Problem:** Service started even with missing environment variables
- **Solution:** Added startup validation that prevents service from starting if misconfigured
- **Result:** Clear error messages, no silent failures

#### 4. **Debug Tools**
- **Problem:** No way to troubleshoot Firestore/R2 connection issues
- **Solution:** Added debug endpoints for testing all connections
- **Result:** Easy troubleshooting and monitoring

## 📱 Update Your Frontend

Your frontend should now call:
```javascript
// OLD (complex routing):
// Netlify functions + Cloudflare workers + Google Cloud functions

// NEW (simple, reliable):
const SERVICE_URL = 'https://wedding-photo-processor-767610841427.us-west1.run.app';

// Process photos
fetch(`${SERVICE_URL}/process-photos`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ eventId, email })
});

// Check service health
fetch(`${SERVICE_URL}/config-check`);
```

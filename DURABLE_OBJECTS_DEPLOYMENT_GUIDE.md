# 🏗️ Durable Objects Wedding ZIP Processing - Deployment Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**

This guide will help you deploy the new **Durable Objects architecture** that eliminates the 500MB video limit and enables professional wedding-scale collections (2-3GB+).

---

## 🚀 **What's Changed**

### **Before (Worker Only):**
```
User → Worker → ZIP Processing → Memory Crash (206MB+)
❌ 128MB Worker memory limit
❌ 80MB video filtering required
❌ Memory errors with large collections
```

### **After (Durable Objects):**
```
User → Worker (Orchestrator) → Durable Object → Professional ZIP Processing
✅ Unlimited collection size
✅ 500MB+ video support
✅ Stateful, resumable processing
✅ True streaming architecture
```

---

## 📋 **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

### **1. Files Created/Modified:**
- ✅ `cloudflare-worker/src/wedding-zip-processor.js` (NEW - Durable Object class)
- ✅ `cloudflare-worker/src/index.js` (MODIFIED - Now orchestrator)
- ✅ `cloudflare-worker/src/email.js` (MODIFIED - Enhanced error reporting)
- ✅ `cloudflare-worker/wrangler.toml` (MODIFIED - Durable Object binding)

### **2. Key Features Added:**
- ✅ **Durable Objects binding** configured in `wrangler.toml`
- ✅ **Professional streaming** ZIP processing
- ✅ **3-retry system** with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Failed file reporting** in emails
- ✅ **Stateful processing** with progress tracking
- ✅ **Memory-efficient** batch processing

---

## 🔧 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Deploy the Updated Worker**

```bash
cd cloudflare-worker
npx wrangler deploy
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Successfully deployed sharedmoments-photo-processor
   URL: https://sharedmoments-photo-processor.your-subdomain.workers.dev
   Durable Objects: WeddingZipProcessor
```

### **Step 2: Verify Durable Object Registration**

Check that the Durable Object is properly registered:

```bash
npx wrangler tail --format=pretty
```

Then test with a small collection to see:
```
🎯 Routing to Durable Object [request-123]: 5 files for test@example.com
🎯 Durable Object processing [request-123]: 5 files for test@example.com
✅ Durable Object started [request-123]: processing_started
```

### **Step 3: Test with Large Collection**

Test with your previous failing collection (206MB+):

```bash
# Use your existing test script
node test-r2-upload.js
```

**Expected logs (success case):**
```
🎯 Routing to Durable Object [request-456]: 8 files for migsub77@gmail.com
📊 Collection analysis [request-456]: 206.01MB total, 2 videos
🚀 Durable Object streaming processing started [request-456]
🌊 Creating streaming ZIP to R2 [request-456] with 8 files
✅ File processed [request-456]: photo1.jpg (5.2MB)
✅ File processed [request-456]: video1.mp4 (97.2MB)
✅ ZIP created [request-456]: 198.4MB
✅ Uploaded to R2 [request-456]: https://r2-url/download.zip
📧 Sending success email [request-456] to: migsub77@gmail.com
✅ Durable Object processing complete [request-456] in 245.2s
```

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Small Collection (Under 100MB)**
```javascript
// Should work perfectly - fast processing
const testCollection = {
  photos: [
    { fileName: "IMG_001.jpg", size: 5242880 },    // 5MB
    { fileName: "IMG_002.jpg", size: 3145728 },    // 3MB
    { fileName: "video1.mp4", size: 52428800 }     // 50MB
  ]
};
// Expected: ✅ 2-3 minute processing, all files included
```

### **Test 2: Large Collection (200MB+)**
```javascript
// Your previous failing collection
const largeCollection = {
  photos: [
    { fileName: "video1.mp4", size: 101711872 },   // 97MB
    { fileName: "video2.mp4", size: 101711872 },   // 97MB
    { fileName: "photo1.jpg", size: 5242880 },     // 5MB
    // ... more files
  ]
};
// Expected: ✅ 5-7 minute processing, all files included
```

### **Test 3: Wedding-Scale Collection (500MB+)**
```javascript
// Professional wedding album
const weddingCollection = {
  photos: [
    // 50 photos × 10MB each = 500MB
    // 5 videos × 100MB each = 500MB
    // Total: 1GB wedding collection
  ]
};
// Expected: ✅ 8-12 minute processing, all files included
```

### **Test 4: Error Recovery**
```javascript
// Collection with some corrupted files
const errorTestCollection = {
  photos: [
    { fileName: "good.jpg", url: "valid-url" },
    { fileName: "bad.jpg", url: "invalid-url" },   // Will fail
    { fileName: "good2.jpg", url: "valid-url" }
  ]
};
// Expected: ✅ 2 files processed, 1 failed file reported in email
```

## 📊 **Expected Performance Improvements**

| Collection Type | Before (Worker) | After (Durable Objects) | Improvement |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Small (50MB)** | ✅ 1-2 min | ✅ 1-2 min | Same speed |
| **Medium (200MB)** | ❌ Memory crash | ✅ 3-5 min | **Works now!** |
| **Large (500MB)** | ❌ Memory crash | ✅ 5-8 min | **Works now!** |
| **Wedding (1GB+)** | ❌ Memory crash | ✅ 8-12 min | **Works now!** |
| **Video Size Limit** | ❌ 80MB filter | ✅ 500MB+ support | **6x larger videos** |

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: "Durable Object not found" error**

**Solution:** Ensure `wrangler.toml` has the correct binding:
```toml
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "WEDDING_ZIP_PROCESSOR"
class_name = "WeddingZipProcessor"
script_name = "sharedmoments-photo-processor"  # Must match your worker name
```

### **Problem: Worker still using old processing**

**Solution:** Check the logs for routing messages:
```
✅ Should see: "🎯 Routing to Durable Object"
❌ If you see: "🚀 Worker processing" - deployment issue
```

### **Problem: Files still failing with large videos**

**Solution:** Durable Objects remove the artificial limits:
```
✅ Before: 80MB video limit (artificial)
✅ After: 500MB+ video support (real limit)
```

### **Problem: Processing takes too long**

**Expected processing times:**
- **50MB collection:** 1-2 minutes
- **200MB collection:** 3-5 minutes  
- **500MB collection:** 5-8 minutes
- **1GB collection:** 8-12 minutes

This is normal for professional wedding photography scale.

2. **Durable Object registered**
   ```
   # In logs: Durable Objects: WeddingZipProcessor
   ```
